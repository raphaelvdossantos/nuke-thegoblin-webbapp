    Nuke, the Goblin bot was created in 2020. His original name was Todd and he
    was created as an excuse for the Mad Wizard to practice python, the
    programming language, while doing something somewhat useful. A project that
    could have some purpose.
    <br /><br />
    But after playing in a table of DnD 5e that started in early 2023 as - you guessed
    - a wizard tha befriended a goblin named Nuke, the Wizard decided to get back
    to the bot (that after a few lines of code was left untouched) and not only finish
    it but give a greater purpose, overhauling the initial simple idea - the bot
    was meant to simply roll dices and some fumbles.
